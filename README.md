# HR-Diversity-Inclusion-Analysis_Lak
As part of the PwC Power BI in Data Analytics Virtual Case Experience, I analyzed an HR Diversity and Inclusion dataset, designing a Power BI dashboard report and defining KPIs to measure the organization's progress.  I formulated KPIs such as Diversity Ratio, Turnover Percentage, and Performance Rating to gain valuable insights.The project enabled data-driven decision-making, provided actionable insights, and facilitated continuous growth towards diversity and inclusion goals.
