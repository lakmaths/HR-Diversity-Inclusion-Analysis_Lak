As part of the PwC Power BI in Data Analytics Virtual Case Experience, I analyzed an HR Diversity and Inclusion dataset, designing a Power BI dashboard report and defining KPIs to measure the organization's progress. I formulated KPIs such as Diversity Ratio, Turnover Percentage, and Performance Rating to gain valuable insights. The project enabled data-driven decision-making, provided actionable insights, and facilitated continuous growth towards diversity and inclusion goals.
Project Details
In this HR Diversity and Inclusion analysis project, I designed a Power BI dashboard report and formulated measures to define relevant KPIs to track and evaluate the organization's diversity initiatives. I analyzed various demographic characteristics, such as gender, age, nationality and utilized the data to calculate critical metrics to gain valuable insights into the organization's diversity and inclusion efforts.
To begin the analysis, I calculated the diversity ratio, comparing the number of female employees in the organization. I then created KPIs to measure the number of male and female employees in the organization, the number of leavers, the percentage of employees promoted in FY20, the percentage of women and men promoted, and the percentage of male and female employees who were newly hired during the specified period.
Other KPIs included the percentage of turnover, the average performance rating of male employees, and the average performance rating of female employees. Using these KPIs, I designed a dashboard report that provided a clear and concise overview of the organization's diversity and inclusion initiatives, including areas of strength and areas that require improvement.
Overall, this HR Diversity and Inclusion Analysis project served as a valuable tool for HR managers to evaluate and measure the organization's progress towards creating a more diverse and inclusive workplace culture. Through this project, I was able to provide actionable insights and data-driven decisions to ensure the organization's continuous growth towards diversity and inclusion goals.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
KPIs are measurable values that organizations use to track and evaluate their progress towards achieving specific business objectives. They are used to measure performance over time and allow organizations to make data-driven decisions based on actual results. KPIs are specific to the objectives of an organization or department and can be qualitative or quantitative. They are important metrics that help organizations identify areas for improvement, set targets for future performance, and track their success in meeting their goals.
Some of the KPIs that were calculated include:
* Diversity Percentage for Females: This KPI measures the percentage of female employees in the organization by calculating the number of female employees in the organization divided by the total number of employees and then multiplying the result by 100.
